```python
# Python program to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... and multiply the total by 4

terms = 10000
series_sum = 0.0

for i in range(terms):
    denominator = 2 * i + 1
    series_sum += (-1) ** i / denominator

result = series_sum * 4
print(result)
```

Output:
```
