My name is Shreya Gupta. I'm an AI/ML Applied Scientist and data scientist, now foraying into Agentic modeling. I'm originally from India, where I grew up primiarily in Bangalore and New Delhi, but I moved to the US in 2014 and have been here since. I got my PhD from UT Austin, and worked in Austin for a few years. I then got at a Bay Area company in 2021 Q1 but officially moved to the Bay are a year later. I finally am now located in SF in Mar 2025 and plan to be here for the long-term and am open to work in the Bay Area.
I have two journal papers from my PhD (submitting journal papers is a much more rigorous process than peer reviewed papers!). I have two more research papers that I am in the process of submitting and should be published soon. I have two patents from my previous company SparkCognition and one patent at eBay! I also led ML meetups in Austin and published application based articles until a few years ago. Now I keep my github up to date and keep myself upto speed with the latest tech advancements in LLMs and Agentic AI.

I love all foods, I grew up a big foodie and my entire family is a foodie. In SF I really like Burmese food in SF (I loveeee Burma Love and Mandalay!!), Italian food in the North Beach Area in SF (the truffle gnocchi at Il Ciliento!), and chinese food from China town in SF (Z&Y!!!). I am a sucker for Pizza and Thai food and pretty much order thai anytime I have people over, and I feel like at some points my friends will get onto this!!
