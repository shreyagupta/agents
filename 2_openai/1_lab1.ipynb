    "#### In the cell below \"trace\" is a context manager:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **context manager** in Python is a construct that allows you to set up a “context” for a block of code, handle setup and teardown automatically, and ensure certain actions are performed before and after the block, even if an error occurs. When applied to a function, a context manager can control resources or behavior specifically while that function runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a more detailed breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **context manager** is typically used with the `with` statement.\n",
    "* It defines two main methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `__enter__`: Code that runs when entering the context.\n",
    "  * `__exit__`: Code that runs when exiting the context, even if an exception occurred.\n",
    "* For a function, using a context manager can automatically handle setup and cleanup tasks, like opening and closing files, acquiring and releasing locks, starting and stopping timers, or managing database connections.\n",
    "* You can create a function-specific context manager using the `contextlib` module, e.g., with `@contextlib.contextmanager`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from contextlib import contextmanager\n",
    "\n",
    "@contextmanager\n",
    "def my_context():\n",
    "    print(\"Entering function context\")\n",
    "    yield\n",
    "    print(\"Exiting function context\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    print(\"Function body running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the context manager\n",
    "with my_context():\n",
    "    my_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Entering function context\n",
    "Function body running\n",
    "Exiting function context\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the context manager sets up a “wrapper” around `my_function`, handling code before and after it runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask Chatgpt for more -> If you want, I can also show **how to make a decorator that acts as a context manager for any function**, which is very useful in real projects. Do you want me to do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the OpenAI SDK, `trace` is a **context manager used for logging and tracking the execution of a block of code**, typically for observability and debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what it does in your example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with trace(\"Telling a joke\"):\n",
    "    result = await Runner.run(agent, \"Tell a joke about Autonomous AI Agents\")\n",
    "    print(result.final_output)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** The `trace` context manager marks the start and end of a logical operation or “span” with a descriptive label (here, `\"Telling a joke\"`).\n",
    "* **Functionality:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * It records metadata about the operation, such as the description, timing, and possibly any intermediate steps or outputs.\n",
    "  * It helps track what the agent is doing at a high level when running tasks.\n",
    "  * Useful for debugging or visualizing how agents execute tasks, especially in complex workflows.\n",
    "* **Behavior:** Anything inside the `with trace(...)` block is executed normally, but `trace` wraps it with logging/monitoring functionality. If an exception occurs, it may also capture that in the trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, `trace` in OpenAI SDK is a **tracing/logging context manager** that wraps a function or block of code to provide structured insights into what happens during execution, without changing the underlying logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask Chatgpt for more -> If you want, I can explain **how it differs from normal logging or Python’s `contextlib` context managers** in terms of usage with agents. Do you want me to?"
